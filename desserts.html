    <h1>Gulab Jamun</h1>
    <div class="description">
        <p>
            Gulab Jamun is a classic Indian dessert made from khoya (milk solids) that are shaped into balls, fried, and soaked in sugar syrup. It's sweet, rich, and perfect for special occasions.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>For Gulab Jamun</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200 grams khoya (mawa)</li>
        <li>50 grams all-purpose flour (maida)</li>
        <li>A pinch of baking soda</li>
        <li>Ghee or oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For Sugar Syrup</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>A few cardamom pods (crushed)</li>
        <li>A few drops of rose water (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare Sugar Syrup:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In a saucepan, combine sugar, water, and crushed cardamom. Bring to a boil until sugar dissolves completely.</li>
        <li>Lower heat and simmer for about 5 minutes. Add rose water if using. Set aside to cool.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Make Gulab Jamun Balls:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Crumble khoya in a mixing bowl and mix in all-purpose flour and baking soda until well combined.</li>
        <li>Knead gently to form a soft dough. Divide into small portions and roll into smooth balls without cracks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Fry Gulab Jamuns:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat ghee or oil in a deep frying pan over low-medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add balls in batches and fry until golden brown on all sides. Ensure that the oil is not too hot to avoid burning them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Soak in Syrup:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Once fried, immediately transfer them to warm sugar syrup. Let them soak for at least an hour before serving.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Syrup Consistency:</b> Ensure that the sugar syrup is warm when adding the fried balls for better absorption.</li>
        <li><b>Add Flavor:</b> You can add saffron strands or rose essence to the syrup for enhanced flavor.</li>
        <li><b>Making Ahead:</b> You can prepare the syrup a day in advance; just warm it up before adding the gulab jamun.</li>
    </ul>
